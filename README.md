# Fandangit

> This was a group project I worked on during my time at Hack Reactor. The focus was on the front-end with less emphasis on server-side and database implementation. The goal was to clone a popular website's item page using our own randomly generated data. Each group member was tasked a separate component to work on.
> Some of the technologies utilized in this project were React, Node, Express, Mongo DB, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Mongo Atlas and more.
